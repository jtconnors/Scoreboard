# Scoreboard

Overview

This archive contains the source code required to build an electronic 
scoreboard.  It is written in Java utilizing the JavaFX 2.x API, and is
packaged as a maven project.  The type of scoreboard chosen for this
implementation pertains to ice hockey.  With an understanding of the overall
organization and structure of the code, it should be straightforward to extend
scoreboard functionality to include other sports.

At start up, the scoreboard executes in one of two modes: as a __master__
(the default), or as a __slave__.  In __master__ mode, the scoreboard user interface is
active.  When a user moves his/her pointing device over an editable part of the
scoreboard (a scoreboard digit), that component will, via JavaFX animation,
increase in size.  This provides the user a visual cue about what component is
in focus.  By either clicking on the focused digit, or by utilizing keyboard
input, the user can change the value of the focused digit.  Each time a
scoreboard digit is modified, an XML packet is created describing the
modification, and sent out over an IP socket.

In __slave__ or remote scoreboard mode, the scoreboard UI is inactive.  That is
to say, it will not respond to any mouse or keyboard input.  Its display
can only be updated by listening in on an agreed-upon IP socket
(configurable by command-line switch) for XML scoreboard update packets.
Upon receiving those packets, the remote scoreboard instance will parse the
XML data and change the scoreboard display accordingly.  To start up a
scoreboard in slave mode, use the ```-slave``` command-line switch.
It is possible (and desirable) to have multiple slave scoreboards
simultaneously receiving updates from one master scoreboard.

This latest version of the source code is tagged ```v1.2-JDK21-maven```.     As its name suggests, it is specific to JDK 21 and can be built with the ```apache maven``` build lifecycle system. Scripts contained in this project will insist that JDK 21 be used, the first LTS release that formally includes the ```jpackage``` utility. Subsequent JDK releases have not been tested with this version of the project.

This project works on Windows, MacOS or Linux.

**Requirements:**
1. Your default JDK should point to a valid JDK 21 runtime in your ```PATH```.
2. Prior to running any of the scripts in this project, either the ```JAVA_HOME``` or ```$env:JAVA_HOME``` (depending upon the platform in question) environment variable must be set to a valid JDK 21 runtime.
3. In order to generate ```EXE``` or ```MSI``` installers for Windows using the scripts in this project, the WiX toolkit version 3.0 or greater must be installed and placed on the ```PATH```.
4. For certain Linux distributions (e.g. Oracle Linux ...) additional tooling, like for example ```rpmbuild```, may be required in order to fully utilize the ```jpackage``` utility.


Of note, the following maven goals can be executed:

   - ```mvn clean```
   - ```mvn dependency:copy-dependencies``` - to pull down dependent ```javafx``` and ```com.jtconnors.socket``` modules
   - ```mvn compile``` - to build the application
   - ```mvn package``` - to create the ```SocketClientFX``` module as a jar file
   - ```mvn exec:java``` to run the Scoreboard application

There are multiple Main classes available, representing different Scoreboard
configurations, that can be run using the following maven commands:

   - ```mvn  test -PMainMulticast``` - Scoreboard using Multicast scokets
   - ```mvn  test -PMainMulticastRemote``` - Remote Scoreboard instance using Multicast scokets
   - ```mvn  test -PMainRemote``` - Remote instance of the Scoreboard
   - ```mvn  test -PMainRemoteClockOnly``` - Remote instance of the Clock only
   - ```mvn  test -PMainRemoteFullScreen``` - Full Screen remote instance of the Scoreboard
   - ```mvn  test -PMainRemoteFullScreenTV``` - Full Screen (minus TV overscan) remote instance of the Scoreboard
   - ```mvn  test -PMainRemoteLED``` - Alternate remote Scoreboard implementation using LED Segments
    
Furthermore, additional ```.sh``` and ```.ps1``` files are provided in the ```sh/``` and ```ps1\``` directories respectively:
   - ```sh/run.sh``` or ```ps1\run.ps1``` - script file to run the application from the module path
   - ```sh/run-simplified.sh``` or ```ps1\run-simplified.ps1``` - alternative script file to run the application, determines main class from ```SocketClientFX``` module
   - ```sh/link.sh``` or ```ps1\link.ps1``` - creates a runtime image using the ```jlink``` utility
   - ```sh/create-appimage.sh``` or ```ps1\create-appimage.ps1``` - creates a native package image of application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```sh/create-deb-installer.sh``` - creates a native Linux DEB installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```sh/create-dmg-installer.sh``` - creates a native MacOS DMG installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```ps1\create-exe-installer.ps1``` - creates a native Windows EXE installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```ps1\create-msi-installer.ps1``` - creates a native Windows MSI installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```sh/create-pkg-installer.sh``` - creates a native MacOS PKG installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool
   - ```sh/create-rpm-installer.sh``` - creates a native Linux RPM installer of this application using JEP-392 jpackage tool

Notes:
   - These scripts have a few available command-line options.  To print out
the options, add ```-?``` or ```--help``` as an argument to any script.
   - These scripts share common properties that can be found in ```env.sh``` or ```env.ps1```.  These may need to be slightly modified to match  your specific configuration.
   - A sample ```Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1``` file has been included to help configure a default Powershell execution environment.  A similar file can be generated specific to environments appropriate for running the ```bash(1)``` shell with a ```.bash_login``` or ```.bash_profile``` file.
